# 30 Days of JavaScript - Log

### Day 1: JS Drum Kit 
*September 28, 2019* 

**Recap:** I struggled a bit with DOM manipulation, so I've read a lot on that topic. I've learnt about other [types of event listeners](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events), given that I'd only used 'click' events until now.

### Day 2: JS Clock
*September 29, 2019*

**Recap:** I've learnt some of the different built-in methods of the [Date object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) that can be really useful.  I'm still getting the hang of some CSS properties, such as transform or transition-timing-function.

### Day 3: Update CSS Variables with JS
*October 1, 2019*

**Recap:** I've learnt about CSS variables and how to declare them and manipulate them with JS. I considered using other types of event listeners, for example a combination of [change](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/change_event) and [mousemove](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/mousemove_event) events. Finally, I chose to use  an [input event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/input_event) since it also gave me the result I wanted to achieve and in less lines of code.

### Day 4: Array Cardio - Day 1 (JS Array Methods)
*October 2, 2019*

**Recap:** I've spent most of this challenge reading through Mozilla docs, so I could understand the application of the following built-in array methods: [Array.prototype.filter()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Filter), [Array.prototype.map()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map), [Array.prototype.sort()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Sort) and [Array.prototype.reduce()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce).

### Day 5: Flex Panel Gallery
*October 3, 2019*

**Recap:** I've expanded my knowledge on CSS manipulation with JavaScript and on the use CSS flexbox, which I hadn't utilised that much until now.

### Day 6: Type Ahead
*October 5, 2019*

**Recap:** I've learnt about [regular expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions), the [RegExp](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp) constructor and the [fetch method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API).

### Day 7: Array Cardio - Day 2 (JS Array Methods)
*October 7, 2019*

**Recap:** I've learnt about the following array methods: [Array.prototype.some()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/some), [Array.prototype.evert()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/every), [Array.prototype.find()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/find), [Array.prototype.findIndex()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/findIndex) and [Array.prototype.splice()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice).

### Day 10: Hold Shift & Check Checkboxes
*October 11, 2019*

**Recap:** It's been the hardest challenge so far. I've mostly followed this written [guide](https://github.com/nitishdayal/JavaScript30/tree/master/exercises/10%20-%20Hold%20Shift%20and%20Check%20Checkboxes) by Nitish Dayal to get through this challenge. I've learnt about the [bind() method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind).

### Day 11: Custom Video Player
*October 12, 2019*

**Recap:** I've learnt about some methods and properties of the HTML video element. I've decided to include a keydown event listener that allows the user to play/pause the video when hitting the spacebar and skip it or rewind it when hitting the left or right arrows, respectively.

### Day 12: Key Sequence Detection
*October 13, 2019*

**Recap:** I've used again some array methods, such as splice() and [join()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/join), and I'm starting to feel comfortable with DOM manipulation and event listeners.
