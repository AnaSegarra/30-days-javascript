# 30 Days of JavaScript - Log

### Day 1: JS Drum Kit 
*September 28, 2019* 

**Recap:** I struggled a bit with DOM manipulation, so I've read a lot on that topic. I've learnt about other [types of event listeners](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events), given that I'd only used 'click' events until now.

### Day 2: JS Clock
*September 29, 2019*

**Recap:** I've learnt some of the different built-in methods of the [Date object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) that can be really useful.  I'm still getting the hang of some CSS properties, such as transform or transition-timing-function.

### Day 3: Update CSS Variables with JS
*October 1, 2019*

**Recap:** I've learnt about CSS variables and how to declare them and manipulate them with JS. I considered using other types of event listeners, for example a combination of [change](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/change_event) and [mousemove](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/mousemove_event) events. Finally, I chose to use  an [input event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/input_event) since it also gave me the result I wanted to achieve and in less lines of code.

### Day 4: Array Cardio - Day 1 (JS Array Methods)
*October 2, 2019*

**Recap:** I've spent most of this challenge reading through Mozilla docs, so I could understand the application of the following built-in array methods: [Array.prototype.filter()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Filter), [Array.prototype.map()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map), [Array.prototype.sort()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Sort) and [Array.prototype.reduce()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce).

### Day 11: Custom Video Player
*October 12, 2019*

**Recap:** I've learnt about some methods and properties of the HTML video element. I've decided to include a keydown event listener that allows the user to play/pause the video when hitting the spacebar and skip it or rewind it when hitting the left or right arrow, respectively.

### Day 17: Sort Without Articles
*October 19, 2019*

**Recap:** I've learnt to sort an array excluding a specific pattern of each item and then include that sorted array in an HTML element. In order to get this done, I've used the RegExp constructor, the [replace method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace) and the sort method.

### Day 18: Adding Up Times with Reduce
*October 20, 2019*

**Recap:** I've used a couple of built-in array methods and some Math methods. I still find a bit confusing the reduce() method, but I think I'll end up getting the hang of it.
