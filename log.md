# 30 Days of JavaScript - Log

### Day 1: JS Drum Kit 
*September 28, 2019* 

**Recap:** I struggled a bit with DOM manipulation, so I've read a lot on that topic. I've learnt about other [types of event listeners](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Eventsw), given that I'd only used 'click' events until now.

### Day 2: JS Clock
*September 29, 2019*

**Recap:** I've learnt some of the different built-in methods of the [Date object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) that can be really useful.  I'm still getting the hang of some CSS properties, such as transform or transition-timing-function.
